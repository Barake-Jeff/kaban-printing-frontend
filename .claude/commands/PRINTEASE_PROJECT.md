## What this project is

PrintEase is a neighbourhood print shop management platform for a home-based printing business in Nairobi, Kenya. Customers submit print jobs via a web app, pay via M-Pesa or on pickup, and track their job status in real time. Clerks manage the queue from an admin dashboard. A separate Electron desktop app on the print PC receives confirmed jobs and handles printing.

## Current build phase

```
Phase:         Backend — NestJS API (Beta)
Goal:          Build and wire up the full backend so the Nuxt frontend
               runs against a real API instead of dummy data.
               Daraja (M-Pesa) and Africa's Talking (SMS) are NOT integrated
               yet — stub those out with placeholder responses.

Build order:
  1. Project scaffold (NestJS, Sequelize, MySQL, config, CORS)
  2. auth       — register, login, JWT access + refresh tokens, logout
  3. users      — profile, house number lookup
  4. jobs       — create, list (customer), list (admin queue), update status
  5. files      — upload, validate, LibreOffice PDF conversion, serve
  6. payments   — pay-on-pickup confirmation; M-Pesa → STUB (returns mock response)
  7. notifications — STUB (log to console only, no real SMS/WhatsApp)
  8. admin      — stats, customer list, queue management endpoints
  9. Frontend wiring — replace dummy store methods with real $fetch calls

Do NOT touch:  Nuxt frontend pages/components unless wiring stores
Do NOT build:  Real Daraja STK Push or Africa's Talking SMS (stubs only)
```

|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | Nuxt 3 + Tailwind CSS + Pinia           |
| Backend          | NestJS + Sequelize + MySQL              |

## API base URL

```
Development:  http://localhost:3000/api
Production:   https://api.printease.co.ke/api   (update when deployed)
```

All routes are prefixed with `/api` via `app.setGlobalPrefix('api')` in `main.ts`.

---

## Complete API contract

These are the exact endpoints the Vue frontend stores call.
Field names in responses must match the frontend dummy data exactly.

### Auth

```
POST   /api/auth/signup          → register new customer
POST   /api/auth/login           → returns { accessToken, refreshToken, user }
POST   /api/auth/refresh         → body: { refreshToken } → new accessToken
POST   /api/auth/logout          → blacklists refresh token
```

### Jobs (customer-facing)

```
GET    /api/jobs/my              → array of jobs for current user
POST   /api/jobs                 → submit new print job
GET    /api/jobs/:id             → single job detail
```

### Payments

```
POST   /api/payments/mpesa/stk   → initiate STK Push, body: { jobId, phone }
POST   /api/payments/mpesa/callback  → Daraja webhook (no auth guard)
PATCH  /api/payments/:jobId/pickup   → confirm pay-on-pickup as paid
```

### Files

```
POST   /api/files/upload         → multipart upload, returns { fileUrl, pageCount, fileName }
GET    /api/files/:filename      → serve file (authenticated)
```

### Admin (admin role only)

```
GET    /api/admin/jobs           → full job queue with customer info
GET    /api/admin/stats          → { jobsToday, pending, completed, revenueToday }
GET    /api/admin/customers      → all customers
GET    /api/admin/customers/lookup?house=14B → single customer by house number
PATCH  /api/admin/jobs/:id/status  → { status: 'printing' | 'ready' | 'delivered' }
PATCH  /api/admin/jobs/:id/payment → mark pay-on-pickup as paid
PATCH  /api/admin/jobs/:id/notes   → { notes: string }
DELETE /api/admin/jobs/:id         → cancel and archive job
```

---

## Standard response envelope

Every endpoint returns this shape. The frontend expects this exactly.

```typescript
// Success
{
  statusCode: 200,
  message: 'Success',
  data: { ... }       // the actual payload
}

// Error
{
  statusCode: 400,
  message: 'Validation failed',
  errors: [ ... ]     // optional array of field errors
}
```

Implement via a global response interceptor in `common/interceptors/transform.interceptor.ts`.

---

## User roles

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  CUSTOMER = 'customer',
  CLERK    = 'clerk',
  ADMIN    = 'admin',
}
```

- `CUSTOMER` — can only see and create their own jobs
- `CLERK` — can view full queue, update job status, mark as paid
- `ADMIN` — everything CLERK can do + reports, settings, customer management

Guards: `JwtAuthGuard` on all protected routes, `RolesGuard` on admin routes.

---

## Job status lifecycle

```
pending → printing → ready → delivered
```

Payment status is separate from job status:

```
unpaid | paid | pay_on_pickup
```

A job with `paymentStatus: 'unpaid'` should NOT enter the print queue until paid.
A job with `paymentStatus: 'pay_on_pickup'` enters the queue immediately.
The admin marks `pay_on_pickup` jobs as `paid` when the customer arrives.

## Naming conventions

| Context         | Convention   | Example                          |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| TypeScript vars | camelCase    | `colorMode`, `deliveryType`      |
| MySQL columns   | snake_case   | `color_mode`, `delivery_type`    |
| Sequelize model | camelCase    | `field: 'color_mode'` in column options |
| API response    | camelCase    | matches frontend dummy data keys |
| File names      | kebab-case   | `jobs.service.ts`                |
| NestJS modules  | PascalCase   | `JobsModule`                     |
| Environment vars| SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY`          |

## What the agent must never do

- Never put business logic inside a controller — controllers receive, validate, delegate, respond only
- Never skip DTOs — every request body must have a DTO with class-validator decorators
- Never hardcode credentials, URLs, or secrets — always use ConfigService
- Never write raw SQL — use Sequelize model methods or query interface
- Never modify the frontend code unless explicitly told to
- Never change field names in API responses without updating dummy.js to match
- Never create a new module without a corresponding entry in AppModule imports
